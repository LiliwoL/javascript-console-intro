JavaScript Console Intro
========================

These files are intended to be used with the JavaScript Console in Chrome.

The idea is that someone brand-new to programming could have this file open:

[JavaScript Intro](http://macloo.github.io/javascript-console-intro/intro.html)

And along with the Console, type or copy/paste from that page to begin to understand:

1. Variables
2. Data Types
3. Arrays
4. Booleans and Comparisons
5. if/else Statements
6. for Loops

After that, this second file -- [JavaScript Functions](http://macloo.github.io/javascript-console-intro/functions.html), also used in conjunction with the Console -- can help a newbie understand:

1. Creating and calling a functions
2. Arguments
3. Returns
4. Scope
