JavaScript Console Intro
========================

These files are intended to be used with the JavaScript Console in Chrome.

The idea is that someone brand-new to programming could have this file open:

[JavaScript Intro](http://macloo.github.io/javascript-console-intro/intro.html)

And along with the Console, type or copy/paste from that page to begin to understand:

1. Variables
2. Data Types
3. Arrays
4. Booleans and Comparisons
5. if/else Statements
6. for Loops

After that, this second file -- [JavaScript Functions](http://macloo.github.io/javascript-console-intro/functions.html), also used in conjunction with the Console -- can help a newbie understand:

1. Creating and calling a function
2. Arguments
3. Returns
4. Scope

The order of examples follows Chapter 19 in *Learning Web Design Fourth Edition
A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web Graphics,* by Jennifer Niederst Robbins. The examples are my own, although they are aligned with examples given in the chapter.

A third file -- [JavaScript Syntax Practice](http://macloo.github.io/javascript-console-intro/syntax.html) -- is also set up for practice using the console. It covers the following property, methods and functions:

- `length`
- `substring()`
- `toString()`
- `parseInt()`
- `isNaN()`
- `Math.random()`

I chose these because they come up often in early programming exercises, and I thought it might be nice to corral them all in one place for easy reference.
